Crispus Stella LLC. is a subsidiary of Cringus STAR Industries速

Crispus Stella LLC. was started 12 years after Cringus STAR Industries(Unknown start date/long before time)
It was started due to a lack of competition and Cringus was sick of winning and getting everything he wanted.

Mr. Star started this business as an alter-ego known as Crispus Stella. Cringus did not need to explain the backstory or how Crispus got rich quick, it is implied
that all people of the Star family are set with a copious amount of cash-money. Cringus is not one to be an insecure playa. Cringus made big moves on starting Crispus Stella LLC.

Crispus Stella LLC within 14 days of its founding was a Star速 Fortune 500 company with employees, (unusual for most Star速 Fortune 500 companies) it is expected to be within the top 10 Star速 Fortune 500 companies by it's 30th day.
